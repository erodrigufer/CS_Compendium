## Start a React project

1. Create a React project with `vite`

```
npm create vite@latest
```

Name the project, select React as the framework and Typescript as the language.

`vite` will create the whole scaffolding for the React project and will compel you to install the require packages for the project.
Get into the directory created for the project and run:

``` 
npm install
```

2. Run the newly created React project

```
npm run dev
```
